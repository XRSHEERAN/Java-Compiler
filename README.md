# Java-Compiler
A compiler forC++ Alike Language implemented by JAVA

## _This is a school project and it is my respnsibility not to commit the codes onto github._ But it is still a great project to see what I achieved from my courses. So I would put comprehensive description here and also partial of the codes. 

# General
This is a project works with Java and two java-based tools: Jlex and Java Cup. This compiler takes a semester to build and includes five phases (six partial programming assignments throughout the semester): Scanning (Extract featured tokens from source codes, Jlex) , Parsing (combine the tokens into programming structures, JAVA CUP), Semantic Analyzer (validate the declarations and their name, JAVA), Type Check (check if the type of the expressions work well, JAVA) and Code Generate (Generate machine codes from the abstract syntax tree)
